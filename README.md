This is a coding challenge for prospective front-end and full-stack developer applicants applying to TechGuilds.

If you're unfamiliar with React, Facebook has put together a helpful tutorial that provides a quick introduction to the basics: https://reactjs.org/docs/hello-world.html

## Goal:

#### Build a simple React app that allows viewing and interacting with a grid of photos from Unsplash

- [ ] Fork this repo into your GitHub account. Keep it public until we have been able to review it.
- [ ] Use `npx create-next-app your_app_name` to set up a Next.js application as shown here: 
https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/create-nextjs-app .
- [ ] Refer to the Unsplash API docs here to set up a developer account: https://unsplash.com/documentation.
- [ ] Display a grid of photos in your React app. Use the `GET /photos` endpoint from the Unsplash API to get a set of curated images.
- [ ] The grid of photos should preserve the aspect ratio of the photos it's displaying, meaning it shouldn't crop the image in any way.
- [ ] The grid should be responsive, and should work in both portrait and landscape orientations on both mobile and desktop browsers.
- [ ] The grid should support infinite scrolling, using a lazy-load strategy to fetch additional images as the user scrolls.
- [ ] You're free to use existing open source React components or Javascript packages/libraries from npm to complete this task.
- [ ] You're free to use any UI framework such as Tailwind, Material UI etc.
- [ ] Write necessary test cases.
- [ ] Deploy your app to Vercel or any other hosting provider. 
Refer to docs how to deploy Next.js app to vercel: https://vercel.com

### Extra Points:
 - Extra points if you use Typescript.
 - When the user taps on a photo on the grid it should show the full photo in a full width lightbox popup with more information about the photo.
 -  The lightbox popup should be dismissible with a close button.

### Evaluation:
- [ ] The app should build without errors (typically using `npm run build`). If there are necessary steps required to get it to compile, those should be covered in README.md.
- [ ] No crashes or bugs .
- [ ] The app should pass all test cases.
- [ ] The app should be deployed to any hosting provider and url of the app should be found in README.md.
- [ ] Code is easily understood and communicative (eg. comments, variable names, etc).
- [ ] GitHub commit history is consistent, easy to follow and understand.
